# What does Tasty help me do?
- [Build Metadata Models](./building_models).  See how templates are used to piece together models
- [Work with Templates](./working_with_templates): See how templates are loaded, validated, and used.
- [Create Custom Templates](./custom_templates): Define your own templates to use
- [Custom Concepts](./custom_concepts): Document and add your own 'tags' or 'fields' for use in your model

# Running examples
Personally enjoy entering an interactive shell after running to be able to play with the datas:
- `poetry run python -i ./examples/working_with_templates/working_with_templates-001.py`

# Templates
There are three valid template types enabled by tasty:
- `point-group-template`: very similar to the [ABSTRACT.yaml](https://github.com/google/digitalbuildings/blob/master/ontology/yaml/resources/HVAC/entity_types/ABSTRACT.yaml) used in the GDB project.
- `equipment-template`:
- `system-template`:
