# NREL Medium Office Implementation
Included in this folder is the input (`mediumOffice.osm`) required to generate this model, and the output (`mediumOffice_brick.ttl`) model generated by the process.
## Generation
Generated using the [OpenStudio Metadata Utility](https://github.com/TShapinsky/openstudio-metadata-utility) with a medium office model by running the `metadata_generation` example in the project. This script generates both Brick 1.2 and Haystack 3.9.10 models from a given OpenStudio model, `mediumOffice.osm` in this case.
