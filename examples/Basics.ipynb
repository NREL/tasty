It can also take a dictionary.  This is used when we are trying to express Datatype Properties (fields). A datatype property is a property of an entity that 'has a value'.  At this point in time, this is only really possible in Haystack (Brick I think is still in process). This has taken inspiration from the Hayson specification. When expressing fields:\n",
    "- The key must be a term in the ontology\n",
    "- `_kind` is a special key.  the value will be resolved to a namespaced term (i.e. number -> ph:number)\n",

From the perspective of Brick, we have likely already done this by getting a namespaced term.  With Haystack, typing is a bit more nuanced, and refers more to the expected functionality (i.e. describing what it _implements_ as well as what it is).  For example, folks used to using sets of markers for expressing the point type above (`cur-air-writable-motor-curVal-sensor-point`) would know they expect to be able to:\n",
